# Crowdfunding-Analysis
 An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
---
---
---
## In this analysis we examined Kickstarter data to make recommendations to best ensure the success of Louise's campaign to put on her play.
---
### One variable examined was success of a theater campagin versus time.

---
    Overall, theater campaigns were very popular, with 912 of them being conducted within the data.  525 were successful.  These included campaigns for plays, musicals, and theater spaces.  This data confirmed to us that Kickstarter was a viable method for raising money in the theater industry.

    It is clear that theater campaigns are most successful with start dates in May, followed by June.  This is a traditional timing of spring theater productions and is probably also related to these months being the start of predictably pleasant weather in many areas of the US, where the majority of these campaigns are conducted, greatly assisting the success of any outdoor programs.  As Louise's production will be in the US we strongly suggest that she begin her campaign in May.

---
### Additionally, we examined summary statistics for amounts desired by and pledged to certain groups of campaigns.
---
    We found that the mean, median, and sample standard deviation of the desired goal amount of successful campaigns to raise money for plays in the US were $5,049, $3,000 and $7,758, respectively.  Louise's goal is to raise $12,000 for her play.  Given that the upper quartile of this set was $5,000, we see that her goal is above the outlier threshold of $5,000 plus 1.5x the interquartile range of $3,500 (a total of $10,250).  To succeed would be to conduct and outlier campaign according to these guidelines.  However, given that the standard deviation of the group, is $7,758, we see that her goal is within one standard deviation of the mean.  These coincide because of the presence of strong outliers in the data, so she should probably still attempt to reduce costs.  Her goal is much closer to the mean of the failed group ($10,554) than that of the successful group ($5,000).  Further analysis may suggest a strong additonial chance of success per dollar cut.

### We also examined summary statistics for musicals in the UK
---
    Louise has a future goal to put on a musical in the UK for about $4,000.
---

---
    Given that the mean goal of musical campaigns in the UK is $4,060, Louise's goal of $4,000 at first appears in line with expectations.  However, as shown in the box and whisker plot, the mean and median of amounts pledged to campaigns for musicals in the UK are $1,047 and $387.  The upper quartile is $1,496 with an IQR outlier threshold of $3,015.  Realistically, raising $4,000 for one of these campaigns is very unlikely, and given that half of the campaigns received less than $400, it is possible the project should be reconsidered if costs cannot be significantly reduced.
